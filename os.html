		OS2 was a very confusingly named 32-bit operating system that was by far the
		most complex project
		I have ever worked on. Developed entirely in x86 assembly over a more than 6
		month period during my
		second semester at Bethel and into the summer, it boasted a custom filesystem
		and bootloader. More experimental than practical it was never run outside of an
		emulator and it didn't run well then either. It fit the preemptive multitasking
		model but preempted on time slices instead of events. This meant that each new
		running process slowed down the other processes even if they didn't need CPU
		time. Despite its flaws and incompleteness it was able to run user applications
		in user mode, used a paged memory system and had enough system calls for 
		applications to make themselves useful. The interface was of course not built
		into the kernel, so if the GUI ended up being too big of a project (it was) I
		could fall back on a command line interface instead.
	</p>

		Sadly this project became too disorganized and inflexibly designed to go much
		further. It did however leave me with a neat piece of software to show off and
		teach me many lessons that I put into practice later with the
		<a href="bootloader.html">bootloader project</a>.
